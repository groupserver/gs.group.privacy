There are standard privacy settings, and non-standard settings.

Standard privacy
----------------

There are four standard privacy settings for a GroupServer
group. They are **always** presented in the following order.

Public:

  * The group is visible to everyone
  * The files are visible to everyone
  * The messages are visible to everyone

Private:

  * The group is visible to everyone
  * The files are visible to group-members only
  * The messages are visible to group-members only

Restricted (or *Public to site members*):

  * The group is visible to members of the site
  * The files are visible to members of the site
  * The messages are visible to members of the site

Secret:

  * The group is visible to group-members only
  * The files are visible to group-members only
  * The messages are visible to group-members only

Non-standard privacy
--------------------

Finally there is one non-standard privacy setting.

Odd:

  * The current permissions fail to reflect a standard
    configuration
